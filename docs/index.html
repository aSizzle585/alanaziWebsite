              Hey, I’m Aziz—studying <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> at
              <strong>Purdue University</strong>. I’m obsessed with
              <strong>Virtual Reality</strong> and the magic of building

              My time doing <strong>bioinformatics</strong> research at
              <strong>KAUST</strong> taught me to love the data side of things, but
              my heart really beats for <strong>immersive tech</strong>—those moments
              when you put on a headset and everything else just… melts away.

            <p class="text-black pt-4 pl-4 pr-4 text-center">
              When I’m not coding or sketching UI ideas, I’m dreaming about
              <strong>startups</strong>—reading founder stories, imagining the next
              breakthrough, and geeking out over everything I learn about
              <strong>venture capital</strong>.

          SCLA 111 helped me see the deeper connections between language, culture, and identity. One of the biggest things I learned 
          was how our cultural background shapes the way we communicate and understand each other. We explored themes like cultural 
          identity, communication across different cultures, and what it means to be a global citizen. Through readings, class 
          discussions, and writing assignments, I became more aware of my own perspective and how to listen to others with more 
          empathy and curiosity. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold text-center pl-8 pr-8">
          This reflection shows how I have grown in expressing my ideas clearly and thinking more critically 
          about the world around me. It is not just about writing better, it is about understanding people better. I have come out of 
          this course more confident in my communication skills and more prepared to interact in diverse environments, whether that 
          is in future classes, work, or everyday life.

        <p class="text-white text-center pl-4 pr-4 font-semibold pb-4">
          Growing up speaking both Arabic and English has always been a big part of who I am. I kind of live in two worlds, 
          and honestly, that used to confuse me. Sometimes I felt like I had to be one version of myself when speaking Arabic 
          with family and a whole different version when speaking English at school or with friends. In SCLA 111, we talked about 
          code switching, and it finally clicked. I realized I am not being fake or trying to fit in. I am just adapting. It is 
          actually kind of a superpower. I switch depending on who I am talking to, and that helps me connect with all kinds of 
          people.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-center pl-4 pr-4 font-semibold pb-4">
          One thing that stuck with me from the class is how people treat languages differently. This idea of language ideology 
          really made me think. Back home, English sometimes gets put on a pedestal, as if you speak it well, you are automatically 
          smart or professional. And Arabic, even though it is my first language, can be looked down on in some academic spaces. 
          That used to make me shy about speaking Arabic in public. But now, I get it. It is not the language that is the issue, 
          it is the bias people have. Every language has its own beauty and depth. I am proud of both.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-center pl-4 pr-4 font-semibold pb-4">
          When it comes to cultural identity, I used to think I had to pick a side. Am I Saudi or am I someone studying in the 
          US trying to fit into a different culture? Turns out I am both. And that is okay. I carry cultural values like hospitality, 
          respect, and family loyalty with me everywhere. At the same time, being in the US taught me the value of speaking up, 
          being independent, and thinking outside the box. I have learned to mix both sets of values depending on the situation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white text-center pl-4 pr-4 font-semibold">
          One last thing I took from this class is intercultural competence. It is more than just knowing how to talk to people
          from different places. It is about listening, being curious, and not making assumptions. This class helped me become
          more aware of how I show up in conversations and how to be more open. My language and culture journey is still going,
          but now I feel more grounded in who I am and how I communicate.

          Throughout the past semester, I have learned many things and built upon lessons I
          gained from the mistakes I made last semester. However, my initial thought that
          this class was just an easy A meant to boost my GPA was one of the biggest
          assumptions I made, and I now see how wrong I was. This class has turned out to be
          one of the most reflective and meaningful courses I have ever taken. It really made
          me think about who I am, where I come from, and how that influences the way I
          see the world.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold text-center pl-8 pr-8 pb-8">
          This realization began from day one when we all introduced ourselves and shared
          the places we came from. A big thing I noticed was the strong emphasis on
          learning about American values, but also connecting them to our own cultural and
          personal values. For example, in Project One, we were asked to create our own
          values that reflect our unique identities and backgrounds. That activity made me
          realize that we each carry a different set of beliefs and ideas shaped by where
          we were raised, the families we come from, and the cultures that surround us.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold text-center pl-8 pr-8 pb-8">
          But that was only the beginning. Our professor continuously made the effort to
          relate our personal backgrounds to the topics we discussed in class. Whether it
          was in group discussions, lectures, or writing assignments, we were encouraged
          to think about how our own experiences shaped the way we interpreted the
          material. This class was not just about memorizing or understanding concepts.
          It was about learning to appreciate others, their cultures, and the different
          ways people see the world. Professor Bras created an environment that felt
          welcoming and respectful, and that made a huge difference.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold text-center pl-8 pr-8 pb-8">
          In Project Two, we each picked an American value and, together with our team
          members, created a presentation showing our understanding of that value. I have
          always been someone who prefers to work alone. I usually try to avoid group work
          because I find it stressful trying to divide tasks or worrying whether the other
          people will do their part. At first, I still felt that way, and I did not enjoy it
          much. But this project helped me realize something important. My teammate
          turned out to be one of the most dependable and supportive people I have worked
          with. It reminded me of how Jem and Scout thought Boo Radley was a monster in
          <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, but in reality, once they gave him a chance, he
          was just a quiet and kind man. I learned a similar lesson from this project—
          sometimes people surprise you in a good way if you just give them a chance.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold text-center pl-8 pr-8 pb-8">
          Finally, we reached Project Three, the capstone of the semester. This project gave
          me a chance to reflect on all the work I have done and everything I have learned
          throughout the course. It brought everything together and made me realize just
          how much I have grown. I learned to reflect deeply, express myself more clearly,
          and connect with others in a more thoughtful and open way.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white font-semibold text-center pl-8 pr-8">
          Even as I move on to my sophomore year, I hope to carry these lessons with me.
          I want to keep learning, growing, and becoming someone who listens and
          understands others better. I am thankful to my professor, Heejeon Bras, to Purdue
          University for giving me this opportunity, and to my country, Saudi Arabia, for
          making it possible for me to study here and gain such a valuable experience.
